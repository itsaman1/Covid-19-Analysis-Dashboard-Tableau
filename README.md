This repository contains code for creating a COVID-19 Analysis Dashboard using Tableau. The project aims to visualize and analyze various COVID-19 metrics, trends, and statistics through interactive and informative dashboards.
## Overview

Ihave successfully designed an insightful COVID-19 analysis dashboard using Tableau, focusing on data from India. Through careful data collection and preprocessing, I ensured the accuracy and reliability of the information presented in the dashboard.

The COVID-19 analysis dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of the pandemic's impact in India, highlighting key statistics and trends. By leveraging Tableau's robust visualization capabilities, I transformed the raw data into interactive charts, graphs, and maps, allowing users to explore and understand the COVID-19 situation in India more effectively.
